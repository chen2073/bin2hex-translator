# Binary to hex value translator

The program is a simple bit calculator. It will set a specific bit of binary value zero to 1, or multiple bits at the same time and return a hexdecimal value.
For example, you have a 16-bit binary zero, and you want to set the 14th bit to 1 and the program will return (4 0 0 0); or you want set 15th, 14th, 9th, 7th, 2nd bit to 1, it will return (C 2 8 4).

Required built-in procedures:
```
quotient
remainder
apply
max
set-difference
```

Usage:
Invoke "convert" procedure to do the calculation.
Convert procedure will either take in only a constant or a list of numbers.
